{"name":"Taq main updater","tagline":"Using this software to get and install the main update package for that particular release of T-AQ. Using this update will provide other updates after this update is applied. It is the main way to update all T-AQ related files.","body":"### T-AQ release development\r\nCurrently, it works well with all T-AQ distributions and other certified T-AQ distributions. This software will be extremely helpful for premium support and patches that will fix all server files problems. Including new features, interfaces updates.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd owlg/taq-main-updater\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe software is aimed at providing the fastest update engine. Faster than the update you are using in Ubuntu and other Linux distribution. Later, I will add parallel downloading (if possible, likely but not confirmed) and other performance features. I will also add special updates only catered for specific distributions.\r\n### Security\r\nWe aim to provide a more secured environment for customers to quickly download updates and install them securely. The files are only for some users and is closely monitored.\r\n\r\n### NO MORE MANUAL UPDATES\r\nYou no longer need to download many updates from Mediafire and other websites and extract them manually and put them in the specific folder. This software is simple and fast that will solve many of those problems. It will ensure that all required updates are installed and extra updates can also be installed in a special extras repository. Update packages can be in different servers and downloaded by the client.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n<a>@owlg</a> Main founder and contributor of page and software.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
